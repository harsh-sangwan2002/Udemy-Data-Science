# Udemy Data Science

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks and scripts covering fundamental and advanced topics in Data Science and Machine Learning. The content is based on Udemy courses and includes implementations using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for data science
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing library for handling arrays and matrices
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis tool
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization library
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and models

## Contents
The repository is structured into multiple sections, each covering different aspects of data science:

1. **Introduction to Python for Data Science**
   - Basics of Python (variables, loops, functions, and object-oriented programming)
   - Working with data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets)
   
2. **Data Analysis with Pandas**
   - DataFrames and Series
   - Data cleaning, transformation, and manipulation
   - Handling missing values

3. **Numerical Computing with NumPy**
   - Arrays, matrix operations, and broadcasting
   - Mathematical and statistical functions

4. **Data Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn**
   - Line plots, bar charts, histograms, scatter plots
   - Customization and styling

5. **Machine Learning with Scikit-learn**
   - Supervised learning (Regression, Classification)
   - Unsupervised learning (Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction)
   - Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning

## Installation
To run the notebooks locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/harsh-sangwan2002/Udemy-Data-Science.git
   cd Udemy-Data-Science
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
